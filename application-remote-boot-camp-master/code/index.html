      <h3> The very first definition</h3>
      <p>
        As the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work using only
        one machine. Each one has a keyboard and a mouse. One programmer acts as
        the driver who codes while the other will serve as the observer who will check the
        code being written, proofread and spell check it, while also figuring out where to
        go next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become the
        observer and vice versa.
        Pair programming is a collaborative effort that involves a lot of communication.
        The idea is to have the driver and navigator communicate, discuss approaches and solve issues
        that might be difficult for a single developer to detect.

      <p>
        It often produces better solutions than either developer could have produced on their own.
        Pair programming provides a process for sharing knowledge and context that is built into your
        everyday workflow.
        One of the biggest benefits of pair programming is learning from your partner.
        Pairing with a more senior developer is the best way for junior developers
        to improve their skills.
